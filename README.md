Hi, I’m George Huang, and game development isn’t just a hobby—it’s a passion that’s been with me for as long as I can remember! My journey began with my younger brother, crafting our own video games in Scratch when we were kids. Those early days sparked a fire in me, fueling my fascination with game design and graphics. This curiosity pushed me to master powerful tools like Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Animate, bringing my creative visions to life. Recently, I’ve also dived into the world of programming, with Python as my first language, adding a new layer of depth to my game development skills.
